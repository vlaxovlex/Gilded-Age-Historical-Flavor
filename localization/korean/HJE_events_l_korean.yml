The Oyo Empire, located primarily to the east of Dahomey, was a military force in the region, conducting raids and exacting tribute from the coastal kingdoms and tribal regions. The situation changed in the last century or so as the Kingdom of Dahomey, consisting mostly of Fon people, was founded on the Abomey plateau and began taking over areas along the coast.

 HJE_britain.9.f:0 "Russia, for all its backwardness, has proven that its resource capability and steadfastness in the face of adversity are not to be taken lightly on the international stage. This was the mistake of Napoleon in 1812, whose attempts to destroy Russia beyond recognition only served to strengthen it in the end. However, what concerns the diplomatic observers of the British Empire, and especially those from within the East India Company, is that Russian influence in regions that border the Indian Subcontinent is growing. It is not unlikely that Russia is preparing to venture southwards and conquer some of these lands. The danger should be obvious, whilst no nation can boast that they rule the waves other than Britannia, the Russian Empire's land army is the largest and most well-equipped in the world, and would certainly be a danger should they set their sights on the Indian Subcontinent. \n\nTherefore, it is in the interest of London to combat wherever possible any and all attempts by St. Petersburg to gain control over Persia or Central Asia. Such a catastrophe would put our only real threat and rival within striking distance of the one and only Crown Jewel of the British Empire..."

Nevertheless, the results of the Great Game are plain for all of the world to see. Great Britain has proven itself to be Russia's superior.\n\nThe Russian stranglehold over the tibes and Khanates of Central Asia has been totally broken. The influence Russia once had over the economy and political affairs of Persia and Afghanistan has withered away, leaving the Lion alone to guide these nations into modernity. At last, there is now nobody capable of challenging Britannia from maintaining her rightful dominance in the diplomatic affairs of Asia."

 HJE_britain.11.f:0 "This conflict has evolved into a long and tiresome affair for both sides. Britain has been engaged more heavily in conflicts amid Asian and European powers than its ministers consider ideal, especially considering that her primary interests in the modern era are in upholding the mission to civilize as much of the world as possible, and to expand her already vast industrial base. Neither of these interests are much served in the vast emptiness and impassable mountains of Central Asia. \n\nRussia, for its part, is no longer interested in conquering India, as it has become embroiled in internal instability. Russia's primary aims beyond consolidating gains made in and around China are to modernize its society, military, and industry, before it is left behind as many an old Empire of centuries past has been. \n\nThe name of the game is Compromise. Persia and Afghanistan are to be granted full independence, and serve as the buffer zone and border region seperating British influence in India and Russian influence in Central Asia. Afghanistan is to be under British economic influence. Russia will have majority influence over Persia, but Britain will benefit from free exploitation of Persia's south. A small strip of land will be granted to Afghanistan in order to prevent Russia and British India from sharing a border."

Many currently in government among the current ruling party argue that [SCOPE.sCountry('CUB_equivallent_spaamerwar_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] is now in it's rightful place as an American protectorate, yet another place from which we can project economic power and allow our markets to enjoy. Their opposition and some pacifist elements within the party have come together to make it clear, however, that they would view this as hypocritical and unbecoming of a nation which claims to be a bastion of Liberty and which just fought valiantly alongside the rebels for  [SCOPE.sCountry('CUB_equivallent_spaamerwar_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFlag] Independence."
